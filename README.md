## Strengths
- (Week 6) Nice tree and bush using L-System with colors and widths of lines.
- (Week 9) Simulation of multiple scenarios in Girl/Boy Proportion Problem.
- (Week 10) Thorough analysis of linear regression.


## Weaknesses
- (Week 2) The analyses of accuracy and running time could be more detailed and robust.
- (Week 3) The code for Pentagon flake is quite long and unreadable.
- (Week 4) The ellipse cannot be rotated arbitrarily.
- (Week 4) I could add more custom effects.
- (Week 7) The fractals are not colored "inside".
- (Week 8) I wasn't able to make the star and the fern MRCM look nice.
- (Week 9) I wasn't able to find out which of the groups 3 and 7 is not randomly generated.
           Also, I didn't find which processes generate them
           (I don't even know how to approach this task.)
- (Week 13) Quantum Maze solver is slow (could be optimized to solve larger mazes).
